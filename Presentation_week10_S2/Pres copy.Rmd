<b style="font-size:24pt">Life impacts (till last week)</b><br>
6.07 million people infected and 7355 people have died. There are many short-term and long-term adverse effects on people who get covid-19. <br>

<b style="font-size:24pt">Economic impacts</b><br>
Australia has lost billions of money because of the pandemic. In 2020, 72% of businesses generated much lower revenue than before. Moreover, the job losses have reached 1.6 million jobs lost in two weeeks after the global pandemic was announced. The underemployment rate hit historically high with 13.8% by the end of April, 2020.

# Research Aim 

__The overall research aim is to evaluate the employment effects of COVID-19 via developing a model for the two-digit subsectors (<u>87 totally</u>) .  __ 

<small style="font-size:14pt"> I'm also trying to solve the following tasks: </small>


--

+ To construct a time series multivariate model of employment in 87 subsectors of the Australian economy. 

--

+ To use this model to conduct a contrafactual analysis 

--

+ To use this model to determine which sectors have the highest impact (or positive spillover) on employment growth.

# Review of Literature 
# Sectoral studies of COVID-19:



.font_my_2[

+ At a worldwide level, International Labor Organisation provided some initial estimates and concluded the "Accommodation & Food services", "Real Estate, Business,& Administrative Activities", "Manufacturing", and "Wholesale & Retail Trade" as high risk sectors. 
 

+ In US, <small style="font-size:13pt">Ludvigson,Ma, and Ng (2020)</small> developed a costly disaster model to translate the impacts of deadly disasters in recent US history and modeled as shocks to predict the COVID-19 influences.  <small style="font-size:13pt">Gregory, Menzio, and Wiczer (2020)</small> expand some Model-based analysis of the disaggregate impacts of 20 sectors. 


+ In France, <small style="font-size:13pt">Barrot, Grassi and Sauvagnat (2020)</small> estimated the impacts at sectoral level. They then use a production network model to estimate the drop of total GDP and sectoral performances.

### Limitation:

However, not many studies have done in Australia (as a small open economy nothing like US, Europe).

### An Aussie story begins:
+ Anderson et al. (2020) conducted a multivariate time series Bayesian VARX model for 19 board sectors in Australia. Their research conducted in 2020 at the time full of uncertainty. Therefore, they applied an "conditional forecasting" method to simulate different scenarios for the sectoral employment in Australia during the pandemic. 



### Limitation:

Some useful information about macroeconomic analysis <u>has been ignored </u> due to the differences in 19 (Board level) sectors and 87 (Two-digit level) sectors.

## Data Wrangling 

<br>

.font_my[

①:An **logarithm** and a **seasonal difference **will be conducted to eliminate the seasonality and make it **stationary**, which will make it easier to conduct further steps.

# Project Design (Data)


<br>

+ **Why don't I use the seasonally adjusted data ?**
--
.font_my_2[

+ Seasonally adjusted sectoral data in ABS do not add up seasonally adjusted total employment. There is no evidence of how they process the data so it will be problematic if we use it. I CANNOT make reliable evaluation !!! 

+ All new changes are expressed in terms of the raw figures.  
]

+ **The Non-classified Data**

.font_my_2[

+ We found there is no further direction to classify the data. Therefore, to make sure the individual dynamics more consistent, we will abandon them.

##Bayesian Inference in VAR modelling

.font_my[
+ **Bayesian inference** derives the posterior probability as a consequence of two antecedents: a *Prior Probability* and a *Likelihood Function* derived based on the observed data.]

.font_my_2[
+ We can think of Bayesian Estimation as $Posterior = Prior\times Likelihood$ ]

$$P(H|E)=\frac{P(E|H).P(H)}{P(E)}$$
.font_small[
**where: H is hypothesis, E is evidence by data. P(H) is prior assumption, P(H|E) is posterior, P(E|H) is likelihood, P(E) is the the marginal likelihood ("model evidence")**  
]

.font_my[

+ We can bring our beliefs (priors) to the parameter. After seeing the data (likelihood), we get the posterior by combining the likelihood and the prior together.

.font_my_2[

+ $\bf{y}_t$ is an $85\times1$ vector of two-digit subsectoral employment growth rate at time $t$ with $\bf{A}_{1}$ are $85\times85$ parameter matrices. There are one lag of growth rate due to the high dimensionality and small sample size. 

+ $x_{t-1}$ is a scalar of one lag of the growth rate of total employment with $\bf{\Gamma}$ is $85\times1$ parameter matrices, which act as economy-wide factors.

# Project Design (Prior Selection)

.font_my_2[
<b>Aim</b>: We use Minnesota prior to shrink the unrestricted model towards a naive benchmark, thereby reducing the parameter uncertainty and improving forecast accuracy. <small style="font-size:11pt">(Anderson et al.,2020;Litterman,    1986;Bańbura,Giannone,&Reichlin,2010;Karlsson,2013)</small>  

]


.font_my_2[

<br>

<b>Benefits</b>:  
 
  a. Eliminate <u>high-dimensionality</u> curse. 
  
  b.  It makes the most <u>recent lag</u> provide more information than distant lags. 
  
  c. It makes <u>own lags</u> explain more than the lags of other variables.
  
]

<br>
  
.font_my_2[
<b>Apply</b> : I will apply it in the BVAR system by creating a Normal- Inverse-Wishart prior (which retain the principal of Minnesota prior) and then adding dummy observations to put the posterior moments of Normal IW prior inside our BVAR system. <small style="font-size:11pt">(Bańbura,Giannone, and Reichlin (2010))</small>

# Project Design (Details)

<b>Mean</b>:

.font_my_2[
 $$E[a_{i}^{jk}] = E[\gamma_{i}^j]=0$$

] 


**Variances**:
--
.font_my_2[
 For the lag of growth rate:

$$Var[a_i^{jk}]=\frac{\lambda^2}{i^2},j=k$$




$$Var[a_i^{jk}]= \frac{\lambda^2}{i^2}\frac{\sigma^2_j}{\sigma^2_k}, otherwise$$

 
 For the lag of total employment:

$$Var[\gamma_i^{j}]=\frac{\lambda^2}{i^2}\frac{\sigma^2_j}{\sigma^2_e}$$
]




.font_small[

<u><b>Note</b></u>: $\lambda$ control the overall tightness(variance of prior distribution); $\frac{1}{i^2}$ downweights distant lags; $\frac{\sigma_j}{\sigma_k}$ adjusts for different scales. 


]


 <!-- If $\lambda\rightarrow0$, we can see that the prior assumption is influential, which means that the posterior getting closer to the prior, so the data have no influence on the estimates. On the contrary, if $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$, the posterior expectations will approach to ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. In many macroeconomic VAR forecasting, data are presented in a large dimension. As the dimension increases, we want to shrink more in order to avoid the over-fitting [@de2008] -->

# Project Design (Modelling)
# A new approach in selecting hyperparameter $\lambda$

.font_my_2[

+ Conventional error measurements (e.g. MAE, MSE or MAPE) are no longer robust when sizes of subsectors are small with various scales. 

]

.font_my_2[

+ We minimising a new error measurement "Root Mean Squared Forecast Error" via an out-of-sample forecasting experiment algorithm. ]


$$RMSFE^{(\lambda,m)}_{i,h}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T_e-T_b-h}\Sigma^{T_{e}-h}_{T=T_{b}}({y}_{i,T+h|T}^{(\lambda,m)}-y_{i,T+h})^2}$$



.font_small[ 

+ where ${y}_{i,T+h|T}^{(\lambda,m)}$ is defined as the $h$-th steps ahead forecast given the information up to time $T$ and $y_{i,T+h}$ is the actual data for the $h$-th steps ahead forecast. Here, $m$ and $\lambda$ stands for the evaluated RMSFE, conditioned on a specific model and the hyperparameter $\lambda$.

# Empirical Results (Sectoral Multiplier Analysis)


.grid[

.font_my_2[

<br>


#### Background

The total employment growth is: 

$$GR_T=\sum_{j=1}^{87} w_j\times {GR}_j$$

<small style="font-size:12pt">(where $w_j$ is the share of employment of two-digit sector $j$ in the total employment and  $GR_j$  is the growth rate in employment of two-digit sector j and  $GR_T$  is the growth rate in total employment )</small>

📈 Due to the interconnection of macroeconomic two-digit subsectors, when a two-digit subsector $j$ has an increase in employment, in the long run, it may have spillover effect onto other two-digit subsectors, especially those that have high connections with the two-digit subsector $j$. 

]



.font_my_2[

<br>

<br>

<ul><b>Why it is useful?:</b></ul>

+ This will take the <u>structure of industries</u> into consideration, which is more closer to the reality. It also allows us to assess the damage of COVID-19 to these industries.  

+ This will help us to evaluate and improve the efficiency. For example, if policies simulate these subsectors, there will be a *bonus* and then we can say <u>"a dollar to these high spillover industries is more valuable than a dollar"</u>

# Empirical Results (Sectoral Multiplier Analysis)
## Long run employment multipliers


.font_my_2[

+ We find that `Other Store-Based Retailing` will generate the strongest positive spillover to the whole economy, followed by `Administrative Services`, `Furniture and Other Manufacturing`. They belongs to the `Retailing`, `Administrative and Support Services` and `Manufacturing` sectors in the broadest level respectively.

]

# Example


.grid[

.font_my_2[

<br>


## Positive spillover scenario:

It's interesting to see that `Gambling` have the positive spillovers. What may happened in this subsector? 


#### Answers: 

+ An appropriate reason could be that the `Gambling` are closely connected with many other subsectors (e.g. Retailing, Services etc). 

+ As a result, if a policy has an immediate effect on increasing the employment in the house construction industry. In the long run, the total employment will rise more than the immediate effect for house construction industry due to the indirect effect on glass and wood manufacturing industry, which has also have a positive impact on the total employment.

## Historically Lowest Unemployment:

Australia has recorded the lowest unemployment level in 48 years. What is the underlying of this when **YOU** said we are still recovering? 


$$U_{emp}=\frac{T_L-T_E}{T_L}$$
.font_small[
where $U_{emp}$ is the unemployment rate; $T_L$ is the total labour force; $T_E$ total employed people.

# Discussions
## Policy Implications

+ More appropriate policies should be targeted to those high-spillover subsectors instead of focusing on a broader levels. 

+  The micro businesses also play important roles in economic recovery. While supporting the large-share sectors, it is essential for the government to pay attention to the micro businesses.


---

# Discussions
## Summary

+ There is no evidence that the pandemic can be controlled or prevented thoroughly but lives together with humans.


---
# Extensions

+ To improve the forecast accuracy, machine learning algorithms or combination forecasts can be considered for accurate and interpretable forecasts. 

<br>
--

+ To make our analysis more broad and easily accessible by researchers or government. An interactive shiny application can be implemented to give a more accessible way and thus benefit more people.

<br>
--

+ Bring more hierarchies to our analysis and make forecasts coherent using the hierarchical forecasting methods.

$\bf{J_p}=diag(1,\cdots,p)$; $\bf{S_0}=(Y_d-X_d\times B_0)'(Y_d-X_dB_0)$, $\bf{B_0}=(X_d'X_d)^{-1}X_dY_d$, $\bf{\Omega_0}=(X_d'X_d)^{-1}$ and  $a_0=T_d-np-p-1;$

Here, both $\bf{Y}_d$ and $\bf{X}_d$ are the dummy observations we set 
where $T_d$ is the number of rows for both $\bf{Y}_d$ and $\bf{X}_d$.

## We can get:

.font_my[

$$\begin{aligned}
\bf{Y^*}=\bf{X^*}\bf{\beta}+\bf{\mu}^*\\:
\end{aligned}$$

where : 


$$\begin{aligned}
\bf{Y^*}=[\bf{Y'},\bf{Y'_d}]';\ \bf{X^*}=[\bf{X'},\bf{X'_d}]';\ \bf{\mu^*}=[\bf{\mu'},\bf{\mu'_d}]'
\end{aligned}$$

Then we can estimate
ng the BVAR by conducting an least square regression of $Y^*$ on $X^*$ . The posterior distribution then have the form of

$$\begin{align}
&\bf{vec(\mathbf{\beta})}|\Sigma,Y\sim N(vec(\bf{\tilde\beta}),\Sigma\otimes(\bf{X^*}'\bf{X^*})^{-1})\ and\\
&\bf{\Sigma|Y}\sim\mathbf{IW}(\bf{\tilde\Sigma},T_d+T-np+2)
\end{align}$$


where $\bf{\tilde\beta} =(X*'X*)^{-1}X^{*'}Y^*$ and $\bf{\tilde\Sigma}=(\bf{Y^*}-\bf{X^*}\bf{\tilde\beta})'(\bf{Y^*}-\bf{X^*}\bf{\tilde\beta})$
