<b style="font-size:24pt">Economic impacts</b><br>
Australia has lost billions of money because of the pandemic. In 2020, 72% of businesses generated much lower revenue than before. Moreover, the job losses have reached 1.6 million jobs lost in two weeks after the global pandemic was announced. The underemployment rate hit historically high with 13.8% by the end of April, 2020.

# Research Aim 

__The overall research aim is to evaluate the employment effects of COVID-19 via developing a model for the two-digit subsectors (<u>86 totally</u>) .  __ 

<small style="font-size:14pt"> I'm also trying to solve the following tasks: </small>



+ To construct a time series multivariate model of employment in 86 subsectors of the Australian economy. 

--

+ To use this model to conduct a counterfactual analysis 

--

+ To use this model to determine which sectors have the highest impact (or positive spillover) on employment growth.

# Review of Literature 
# Sectoral studies of COVID-19:



.font_my_2[

+ At a worldwide level, International Labor Organisation provided some initial estimates and concluded the "Accommodation & Food services", "Real Estate, Business,& Administrative Activities", "Manufacturing", and "Wholesale & Retail Trade" as high risk sectors. 
 

+ In US, <small style="font-size:13pt">Ludvigson,Ma, and Ng (2020)</small> developed a costly disaster model to translate the impacts of deadly disasters in recent US history and modeled as shocks to predict the COVID-19 influences.  <small style="font-size:13pt">Gregory, Menzio, and Wiczer (2020)</small> expand some Model-based analysis of the disaggregate impacts of 20 sectors. 


+ In France, <small style="font-size:13pt">Barrot, Grassi and Sauvagnat (2020)</small> estimated the impacts at sectoral level. They then use a production network model to estimate the drop of total GDP and sectoral performances.

### Limitation:

However, not many studies have done in Australia (as a small open economy nothing like US, Europe).

# Review of Literature

<br>

<br>

.grid[
.font_my_2[

### An Aussie story begins:
+ Anderson et al. (2020) conducted a multivariate time series Bayesian VARX model for 19  broad sectors in Australia. Their research conducted in 2020 at the time full of uncertainty. Therefore, they applied an "conditional forecasting" method to simulate different scenarios for the sectoral employment in Australia during the pandemic. 



### Limitation:

Some useful information about macroeconomic analysis may lose due to the differences in 19 (broad level) sectors and 86 (Two-digit level) sectors.

## Data Wrangling 

<br>

.font_my[

①: Some small or new subsectors(e.g. Internet Publishing) have no historical records of employment, we combine them with similar sectors that are "non-zero".]

--

<br>


.font_my[

②: An **logarithm** and a **seasonal difference ** will be conducted to eliminate the seasonality and make it **stationary**, which will make it easier to conduct further steps. 

]

# Project Design (Data)


<br>

+ **Why don't I use the seasonally adjusted data ?**
--
.font_my_2[

+ Seasonally adjusted sectoral data in ABS do not add up seasonally adjusted total employment. Due to the seasonality of post-COVID data have changed. I CANNOT make reliable evaluation !!! 

+ All new changes are expressed in terms of the raw figures.  
]

--

<br>


+ **What about the non-classified Data?**

--
.font_my_2[

+ We found there is no further direction to classify the data. Therefore, to make sure the individual dynamics are consistent, we will not consider them in our research.

# Project Design (Modelling)

+ **Vector Autoregression** with **Exogenous Variable** Model (VARX) is a useful model to estimate the dynamic behaviors of the relationship between variables in a statistically coherent way. <small style="font-size:14pt">(Anderson et al.,2020;Litterman, 1986;Bańbura,Giannone,&Reichlin,2010)</small>


$$\textbf{y}_t=\textbf{c}+\textbf{A}_1 \textbf{y}_{t-1}+\bf{\Gamma}\textbf{x}_{t-1}+\bf{u}_t$$
.font_small[
**where:**  
]


.font_my_2[

+ $\bf{y}_t$ is an $84\times1$ vector of two-digit subsectoral employment growth rate at time $t$ with $\bf{A}_{1}$ are $84\times84$ parameter matrices. There are one lag of growth rate due to the high dimensionality and small sample size. 

+ $x_{t-1}$ is a scalar of one lag of the growth rate of total employment with $\bf{\Gamma}$ is $84\times1$ parameter matrices, which act as economy-wide factors. 

+ Reduced form errors $\bf{u}_t \sim N(0,\bf{\Sigma})$.

# Project Design (Modelling)
##Bayesian Inference in VARX modelling

.font_my_2[
+ We have 7224 parameter to estimate (frequentist is not suitable). $\bf{\beta}$ contains $\bf{c}$, $\bf{A_1}$ and $\bf{\Gamma_1}$

+ **Bayesian inference** derives the posterior probability as a consequence of two antecedents: a *Prior Probability* and a *Likelihood Function* derived based on the observed data.]

<br>

--

.font_my_2[
+ We can think of Bayesian Estimation as $Posterior = Likelihood\times Prior$ ]

$$f(\bf{\beta}|y)\propto L(\beta|y)f(\beta)$$
.font_small[
$f(\bf{\beta})$ = the **prior** pdf for $\bf{\beta}$;expresses prior uncertainty about the $\beta$

$f(\bf{\beta}|y)$ = the **posterior** pdf of $\bf{\beta}$; expresses uncertainty about $\beta$ **after** having observed the data $\bf{y}$ (or **conditional** on the observed data)
]

.font_my[

+ We can bring our beliefs (priors) to the parameter. After seeing the data (likelihood), we get the posterior by combining the likelihood and the prior together.

# Project Design (Prior Selection)

<br>

.font_my[
<b>Aim</b>: We use Minnesota prior to shrink the unrestricted model towards a random walk, thereby reducing the parameter uncertainty and improving forecast accuracy. <small style="font-size:11pt">(Anderson et al.,2020;Litterman,    1986;Bańbura,Giannone,&Reichlin,2010;Karlsson,2013)</small>  

]


.font_my[

<br>

<b>Benefits</b>:  
 
  a. Eliminate <u>high-dimensionality</u> curse. 
  
  b.  It makes the most <u>recent lag</u> provide more information than distant lags. 
  
  c. It makes <u>own lags</u> explain more than the lags of other variables.
  
]

<br>
  
.font_my_2[
<b>Apply</b> : I will apply it in the BVAR system by creating a **Normal- Inverse-Wishart prior** (which *retain the principal of Minnesota prior*) and then adding dummy observations to put the posterior moments of Normal IW prior inside our BVAR system. <small style="font-size:11pt">(Bańbura,Giannone, and Reichlin (2010))</small>

<b>Mean</b>:

--
.font_my_2[
 $$E[a_{1}^{jk}] = E[\gamma_{1}^j]=0$$

] 

--


**Variances**:

--
.font_my_2[
 For the lag of growth rate:

$$Var[a_1^{jk}]=\lambda^2,j=k$$




$$Var[a_1^{jk}]= \frac{\lambda^2\sigma^2_j}{\sigma^2_k}, otherwise$$

 
 For the lag of total employment:

$$Var[\gamma_1^{j}]=\frac{\lambda^2\sigma^2_j}{\sigma^2_e}$$
]




.font_small[

<u><b>Note</b></u>: $\lambda$ control the overall tightness(variance of prior distribution) and governs the relative importance of the prior beliefs *w.r.t* the information contained in the data;  $\frac{\sigma_j}{\sigma_k}$ adjusts for different scale and variability. 


]


 <!-- If $\lambda\rightarrow0$, we can see that the prior assumption is influential, which means that the posterior getting closer to the prior, so the data have no influence on the estimates. On the contrary, if $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$, the posterior expectations will approach to ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. In many macroeconomic VAR forecasting, data are presented in a large dimension. As the dimension increases, we want to shrink more in order to avoid the over-fitting [@de2008] -->

# Selection of hyperparameter $\lambda$

.font_small[ 

+ where ${y}_{i,T+1|T}^{\lambda}$ is defined as the $1$-th steps ahead forecast given the information up to time $T$ and $y_{i,T+1}$ is the actual data for the $1$-th steps ahead forecast. Here, $\lambda$ stands for the evaluated RMSFE, conditioned on the hyperparameter $\lambda$.

# Empirical Results (Sectoral Multiplier Analysis)


.grid[

.font_my_2[

<br>


#### Background

The total employment growth is: 

$$GR_T=\sum_{j=1}^{84} w_j\times {GR}_j$$

<small style="font-size:12pt">(where $w_j$ is the share of employment of two-digit sector $j$ in the total employment and  $GR_j$  is the growth rate in employment of two-digit sector j and  $GR_T$  is the growth rate in total employment )</small>

📈 Due to the interconnection of macroeconomic two-digit subsectors, when a two-digit subsector $j$ has an increase in employment, in the long run, it may have spillover effect onto other two-digit subsectors, especially those that have high connections with the two-digit subsector $j$. 

]



.font_my_2[

<br>

<br>

<ul><b>Why is it useful?</b></ul>

+ This will take the <u>structure of industries</u> into consideration, which is more closer to the reality. It also allows us to assess the damage of COVID-19 to these industries.  

+ This will help us to evaluate the efficiency of policies. For example, if policies simulate these subsectors, there will be a *bonus* and then we can say <u>"a dollar to these high spillover industries is more valuable than a dollar"</u>

# Discussions⌕

**Policy Implications**

<br>

.font_my[

📈 More appropriate policies should stimulate those high-spillover subsectors in a disaggregated level if government want to increase the number of employment more effeciently. 

<br>

👷The COVID-19 has affected the total employment and the labour force participation. Policies should focus on both employment and total labour force at this stage.
 
<br>
📉 Government should be aware that relatively low unemployment rate may reflect the labour shortage (E.g. Reforming the immigration system or issuing more WHV to attract more labour overseas).
