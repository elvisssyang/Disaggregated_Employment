# Data collection and exploratory analysis

## Data Introduction and wrangling 



The data I use for this thesis comes from the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which covers 86 industry sub-divisions of main jobs. The ABS records the employment (measured in thousands of people $('000)$) from $1984:Q4$ to $2021:Q4$ with a structure shown in Figure \ref{fig:anzsic}.

Although seasonally adjusted data is available in [@ABS2022], however, the seasonal adjustment of post-COVID data is problematic as shocks caused by lockdowns would affect the post-covid seasonality. In addition, the seasonally adjusted subsectoral data do not add up to total employment, which prevents the model from maintaining internal consistency (such as forecasting coherence) in the model. Therefore, rather than using the seasonally adjusted data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, I use the original quarterly employment data with transformations (see description below) to capture any potential changes in seasonal patterns.



In this thesis, I only downloaded the data from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the second quarter of 2022. I also use Microsoft Excel to extract both the employment for two-digit disaggregated levels as well as total employment. It should be noted that some of the data are zero, which makes a log transformation impractical. As a result, I will make the changes below to get rid of them while preserving the coherence of the data structure. The cleaned data can be seen in the *ABSemp.xlsx* file at (https://github.com/elvisssyang/Disaggregated_Employment).


+ Merge the two-digit subsector *57- Internet Publishing and Broadcasting* and *54- Publishing (except internet)* to a new combined subsector called *54 Publishing and broadcasting*. 


+ Combine the *96 Private Households Employing Staff and Undifferentiated Goods and Service Producing Activities of Households for Own Use* and *95 Personal and Other Services* as *95 Personal and other services (include activities for own use)*.


It is obvious that the  ABS employment data contains few non-classified series (nfd). Because ABS offers no additional information, I will not discuss these series in this thesis. If this is incorporated into the model, it will have an impact on the sectoral dynamics. To make the forecasts coherent (sum to total employment) and analysis universal, I will not take them into account at this stage. As a result, my total employment data differs from the total employment data that has been published. The largest discrepancy, however, concerns only a small portion of the real total employment. Accordingly, this will not have a big impact on our analysis. 

<!-- The largest discrepancy, however, is only 12 % of the total employment.  -->



When there are no zeros, a log transformation can be used to explain the percentage change in employment. To generate accurate forecasts from the estimated VAR model, we need the data to be stationary. Thus, I will further apply a fourth difference (seasonal difference) to eliminate the seasonality and nonstationarity for the original quarterly data.

Finally, in *Chapter 6*, I also combine the following data together with the number of employment by subsectors [@ABS2022] to further support our counterfactual analysis: 

+ Total Labour Force: Downloaded from ABS website (see @ABS2022) ^[This includes the number of employment by subsectors, which is the original data we use in this thesis.]. 

+ Unemployment Rate: Downloaded from ABS website (see @ABS2022a)

<!-- + Total "Jobkeeper" Payments by Industy: This dataset has combined three different datasets representing two phrases for the Jobkeeper periods. (see @ABSj1 for the first phrase; @ABSj2,@ABSj3,@ABSj4 for the second phrase) -->




## Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis


Figure \ref{fig:19} illustrates the changes in the raw data for 19 key sectors in Australia between 2010 and 2022. As a result of business closings and travel bans in 2020:Q2, we can observe that the number of total employment dropped substantially (from around 13,200,000 to 12,200,000 in $2020:Q2$). Figure \ref{fig:19} illustrates how most industries behaved similarly and underwent significant changes during the pandemic. The "Accommodation & Food", "Media & telecom" and "Arts" industries have experienced a severe loss of employment when compared to the previous data of these industries, and have not yet fully recovered to the pre-covid level. Some industries, such as "Financial" and "Healthcare", on the other hand, essentially remained the same as pre-COVID period and displayed an ongoing upward trend.


When compared to the sectoral level, the employment of subsectors at the two-digit level illustrates a different pattern (see Figure \ref{fig:86}). As shown in Figure \ref{fig:86}, the subsectors "Food and Beverage Services", "Construction Services", "Professional, Scientific and Technical Services (Except Computer System Design and Related Services)" and "Other Store-Based retailing" are relatively large subsectors with various losses. For example, the “Food and Beverage Services” subsector increased steadily from 2010 Q1 to 2020 Q1, but was significantly impacted by the first lockdown in 2020 Q2, which resulted in a loss of about 210,000 employed people. On the other hand, “Construction Services”, which belongs to the construction sector, did not experience a sizable decline during the pandemic. Similar to the “Professional, Scientific and Technical Services” subsector, it recovered the loss in just two quarters and is expected to increase in the future. 


However, only taking into account the 19 broad sectors has a disadvantage in that the two-digit subsectoral dynamics of these sectors might not be consistent with their aggregated sectoral changes. For instance, one might assume that the corresponding subsectors would exhibit the same pattern based on the aggregated performance of the "Education" and "Healthcare" sectors at the 19 sectoral level (see Figure \ref{fig:19}). However, the reality is that while there is an overall upward trend in the "Healthcare" sector or in the "Education" sector, some of their two-digit subsectors perform differently (e.g. "Residential Care Services" and "Tertiary Education" ) (see Figure \ref{fig:86}). This indicates that not all two-digit subsectors behave in the same way as the sectoral level.




The top five and bottom five two-digit subsectors in terms of their year-on-year growth rate of "2022 Q2" are shown in Table \ref{tab:comp}. From Table \ref{tab:comp}, we can see that "Other Transport", "Non-Metallic Mineral Mining and Quarrying" and "Sports and Recreation Activities" were the industries that affected most by the lockdown in "2020 Q2". However, not all subsectors suffered a lot in "2020 Q2". During this period, both "Water Transport" and "Gas Supply" had a remarkable increase, followed by "Broadcasting (except Internet)" and "Exploration and Other Mining Support Services".
