# Abstract {-}


We develop a multivariate time series model of employment in Australia at a disaggregated level with 87 sectors in total. We use this model to determine the long run employment spillovers to the total employment at this level. Our findings is that ... Moreover, we provide an interactive shiny app that will give an intuitive visualization of these changes. At the stage of recovering from COVID-19, it will provide more useful information for policymakers on recovering total employment rate more effectively.
