# Sectoral Employment Analysis 



## Long-run Multiplier Analysis 

Because industries are interdependent, changes in one subsector can affect both other subsectors as well as total employment. In this chapter, the sectoral employment dynamics for each subsector will be captured using the dynamic structure of the multivariate Bayesian VAR model.



The following analysis is based on the estimated BVAR model and 84 two-digit disaggregated data. I assume that the structure of Australian economy will not change after COVID-19. 



At each time point, the growth rate of total employment and the growth rates of sectoral employment satisfy the following identity:

$$
GR_T=\sum_{i=1}^{84} w_i\times {GR}_i
$$

where $w_i$ is the share of subsector $i$, $GR_T$ is the growth rate of total employment and $GR_i$ is the growth rate in employment of subsector $i$. 




In particular, if there is a one percent increase in employment in subsector *i*, total employment will increase by the corresponding share($w_i$) simultaneously. Additionally, given an increase in total employment, it may also have indirect effects on other sectors in consecutive periods, especially those with close economic ties. In accordance with @anderson2020's definition, I define the employment long-run employment multiplier as the effect of an initial increase in sector *i* on total employment in the long run. If the subsector has a greater long-run effect on total employment than its immediate effect, then stimulating this sector will have a positive spillover effect on total employment. 




I simulate the long-term employment multiplier for each sector over time horizons of one year, two years and ten years using the estimated Bayesian VARX model. Subsequently, the differences between the simulated ten-year multipliers and the initial shares are the spillovers of the disaggregated subsectors. I list the 10 subsectors with strongest positive spillovers alongside the 10 subsectors with strongest negative spillovers in Table \ref{fig:spl}. A comprehensive list can be found in Appendix B (see Table \ref{dis:emp}).

  \label{fig:spl} 
\end{table}




Comparing the long-term multipliers with the shares, we discover that "Other Store-Based Retailing" ^[This subsector contains the following groups: 421. Furniture, Floor Coverings, Houseware and Textile Goods Retailing; 422. Electrical and Electronic Goods Retailing; 423. Hardware, Building and Garden Supplies Retailing; 424. Recreational Goods Retailing; 425. Clothing, Footwear and Personal Accessory Retailing; 426. Department Stores; 427. Pharmaceutical and Other Store-Based Retailing] will generate the greatest positive spillover effects on total employment, followed by "Administrative Services"^[This subsector contains the following groups: 721. Employment Services; 722. Travel Agency and Tour Arrangement Services; 729. Other Administrative Services.], and "Furniture and Other Manufacturing". At the broadest level, these subsectors fall under the "Retailing", "Administrative and Support Services" and "Manufacturing" sectors respectively. These results suggest that total employment will increase over and above the initial increase in these sectors if there is an exogenous increase in these sectors. 




There are also some interesting points to be noticed here. First, both the sign and the magnitude of spillover effect are not solely dependent the size of subsectors. For instance, "Fishing, Hunting and Trapping" is the smallest sector (see Table \ref{dis:emp}). Nevertheless, it generates positive spillovers. In addition, "Furniture and Other Manufacturing" is a relative small subsector but generate stronger spillover than "Food and Beverage Services", a relative large subsector^[The share of "Furniture and Other Manufacturing" is 0.00496526, whereas the share of "Food and Beverage Services" is 0.06348661]. Contrarily, both the "Professional, Scientific and Technical Services" and "Construction Services", which are large subsectors but generate negative spillovers in the long run. 






Second, I discover that subsectors in the "Construction" sector^[Construction Sector contains three subsectors: 30. Building Construction; 31. Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction;32. Construction Services] may not bring strong positive spillovers in the two-digit level, which is in contrast to the result concluded by @anderson2020. The "Construction Service" subsector, for example, will not have positive spillovers even though the overall spillover effect of the "Construction" sector being positive^[The spillover for the "Construction" sector is equal to the sum of all its subsectors (-0.0004619 + 0.00271218 +0.00066987 = 0.00292015). In this case, it is still positive but no longer strong.]. This further demonstrates the necessity of expanding the research to a finer partition (more disaggregated level)



<!-- Although the total spillovers of the "Construction" sector is still positive^[The Spillover for the "Construction" sector is equal to the sum of all its subsectors (-0.0004619 + 0.00271218 +0.00066987 = 0.00292015)], individual subsectors may not have positive spillovers, like the "Construction Service" subsector. This also proves the importance of extending the research to a finer partition (more disaggregated level). -->





Third, both "Tertiary Education" and "Adult, Community and Other Education" generate negative spillovers, which implies that stimulating the education industry will probably reduce total employment in the long run. This is mainly because if one decides to pursue a postgraduate degree or a certificate, then the focus will shift away from working/finding jobs. The results are also in line with the broadest level (19 sectors) analysis that undertaken by @anderson2020. 





## Evaluations after COVID-19





### Losses of Total Employment 



<!-- Based on the fact that COVID-19 can spread quickly and there is no wonder drug to prevent at the moment, it is expected that the COVID-19 still have a long-term impact on the Australian labour market. -->

<!-- The pandemic has caused massive losses to the Australian labour market. Nevertheless, based on the fact that COVID-19 can spread quickly and there is no wonder drug to cure it at the moment, it is expected that the COVID-19 still have a long-term impact on the Australian labour market. At this stage, an evaluation and counterfactual analysis would help to raise the awareness of the impacts of COVID-19.  -->

<!-- It is now commonly known that COVID-19 can be rigorously prevented by vaccines, face masks, and social distancing. We can never fully stop transmission of the virus or from being infected unless there is no interaction among people. -->


<!-- Based on the fact that COVID-19 can spread quickly and there are no wonder drugs to prevent outbreaks of new variants at the moment, it is expected that COVID-19 will still have a long-term impact on the Australian labour market. -->

Based on the fact that COVID-19 can spread quickly and there is no wonder drug to prevent outbreaks of new variants so far, we will never be able to completely halt the virus' spread or prevent infection unless there is no human contact. As a result, it is anticipated that COVID-19 has caused massive losses to the Australian labour market and these negative effects will be persistent in the long run. To prove my idea and raise awareness about COVID-19, I will conduct a counterfactual analysis by evaluating the difference of total employment with and without the pandemic. In this section, I use the estimated model to conduct a counterfactual analysis for total employment after the pandemic. Similar to @anderson2020, I will consider a "no-COVID" scenario. In light of the fact that the pandemic has already occurred, other scenarios are not taken into account. Recent data will be used to compare and evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on the labour market. 











\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{cont_analysis}
\centering
\caption{Counterfactual analysis of total employment(in thousands) with confidence interval generated via bootstrap (Blue is counterfactual scenario (no-COVID);Black is the actual data)}
\label{fig:con}
\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:con} displays COVID-19 has caused a continuous structural shock of total employment in Australia since the outbreak of COVID-19. Based on the point forecasts together with an 80% confidence interval (via empirical bootstrap^[As there are 7224 parameters to estimate, we do not use the Bayesian prediction intervals concerning the time complexity required when taking high-dimensional integrals. ]), our model indicates that employment losses remained at approximately 750,000 persons below where it would have been without the pandemic (see the differences in Figure \ref{fig:con}). By comparing the trend of the "no-pandemic" scenario and that of the actual data, the essentially parallel trend revealed that we may not expect total employment to attain the forecasts under the no-COVID case in the anticipated future. That is, COVID-19 has had a long-lasting effect on the economy even after two years of the primary lockdown in 2020 "Quarter 2". 











\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{yoy1}
\centering
\caption{Counterfactual analysis of Year-on-Year growth rate (forecasts generated via the estimated BVAR model)}
\label{fig:yoy}
\end{figure}




Additionally, I have also considered the Year-on-Year growth rate for quarterly total employment data from 2020 Q2 to 2022 Q2 (up-to-date at the time of collecting). According to Figure \ref{fig:yoy}, the actual employment growth was far below from the expected growth, particularly in 2020 Q2, when Australia was experiencing the first lockdown. After that, the year-on-year growth rate gradually recovered back to "no-COVID" forecasts,but total employment is still lower than it would be under the "no-COVID" situation. Again, it has been emphasized the finding above and we may not expect the influences of COVID-19 to disappear unless there is a higher year-on-year growth rate and persists for a while in the future. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that COVID-19 has indeed a significant impact on the labour market both in the short term as well as in the long term based on the counterfactual analysis of employment and the year-on-year growth rate. 



<!-- Therefore, based on the counterfactual analysis of both employment and the year-on-year growth rate, it is reasonable to believe that COVID-19 has indeed a significant impact on the labour market in the short run as well as in the long run. -->



<!-- According to the enlarged graph on the right of Figure \ref{fig:con}, the gap seems to be smaller than before, which is due to the recovery of year-on-year growth rate (see Figure \ref{fig:yoy}). However, the trend for the actual data intends to be smoother in the future. On the other hand, the both lower and upper bound of the confidence interval has a sharp trend, making the actual data more difficult to recover from losses. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the COVID-19 has indeed a significant impact in the labour market in the short run as well as in the long run. Again, it has emphasize the finding above as "We may not expect the employment number to recover at the no-COVID level in a short period." -->




<!-- we can see the growth rate had a sharp increase than the previous year (at the time the shock happened). Even though the year-on-year growth rate has recovered to a no-COVID level, which means the influences of COVID-19 has mitigated. However, the losses has not fully covered unless there is a higher growth rate continuing for a period. Therefore, it has further underscore the damage of COVID-19 to the labour market cannot be fully recovered in a foreseen future.  -->

<!-- \caption{Forecast values of Year-on-Year growth rate till "2025 Q1" generated via the estimated BVAR model} -->
<!-- \label{fig:yoy2} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->






<!-- Apart from this, I've also provided the forecasts under the optimistic scenario in Figure \ref{fig:yoy2} (i.e. no-COVID) for the total employment growth via the estimated model. At the moment, we may still expect the year-on-year growth rate maintain a level between the 3.25 to 3.75 percent till the "2024 Quarter 4". Again, unless the actual year-on-year growth rate is higher than the optimistic growth rate and persist for a while, we will not expect the influences of COVID-19 has fully perished. -->




### An explanation for the historically low unemployment rate 




In June 2022, Australia fell to its the lowest unemployment rate since August 1974 (@ABS2022a). Then one might be interested in learning what the underlying reason for this incredibly low unemployment rate. Are the stimulus policies during COVID-19 that have contributed the most to the low unemployment rate? In answering this question, I will use a counterfactual analysis of the unemployment rate to exploit why and what the unemployment rate would have been without the pandemic case. 




<!-- Is it a sharp increase in the total employment? Or it can be something else? However, as mentioned before, it is impossible that the total employment market to recover at the no-COVID level in a short term.  -->




To give an accurate interpretation of the low unemployment rate, the answer should refer to the definition, which is the percentage of people who are in the labour force but are unemployed. Mathematically, it is: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Unemployment Rate}=\frac{Total\ Labour\  Force- Number\ of \ Employed \ People}{Total\ Labour \ Force}
\label{equ:unemp}
\end{aligned}
$$



It is obvious that the unemployment rate depends on both the total labour force and the number of employed people. According to the estimated BVAR model suggests that employment is less than it would have been in the absence of COVID (see *Chapter 5*). Therefore, given the low unemployment rate and fewer employed people than in the no-COVID scenario, one explanation might be a significant drop in the total labour force after the pandemic. 



To further support this hypothesis, I use quarterly labour force data from ABS from "1984 Q4" to "2022 Q2" [@ABS2022]. In addition, a stepwise `ARIMA` model [@fpp3] is used to fit the "no-COVID" data between "1984 Q4" and "2020 Q1" to forecast the total labour force under the "no-COVID" scenario (see Figure \ref{fig:lab}). Compared with the actual data, it is evident that the real total labour force is lower than the "no-COVID" forecasts at the time when the unemployment rate is at its lowest historically. Therefore, rather than the effects of stimulus policies during the pandemic period, the main reason for the low unemployment rate is the decline in the total labour force. 











\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{con_labourf}
\centering
\caption{Counterfactual analysis of the total labour force (Blue: the forecasts under the no-COVID scenario, Black is the Actual Data)}
\label{fig:lab}
\end{figure}


After looking into the underlying reason for the low unemployment rate, I also studied how the unemployment rate would perform in the absence of COVID-19. The forecasts of the no-COVID unemployment rate is calculated as the difference between the total labour force and employment rate over the total labour force under the no-COVID scenario. It is noteworthy that the anticipated unemployment rate (under no-COVID scenario) can still be the lowest on record, even with a larger labour force and total employment. 







Overall, the findings suggest that we would have experienced the historically low unemployment rate even in the absence of COVID-19. This further assures us that the policies directed at stimulating employment during the pandemic (e.g. Jobkeeper program) are unlikely to be responsible for the current historically low unemployment rate.



<!-- policies directed at stimulating employment during the pandemic (e.g. Jobkeeper program) are unlikely to be responsible for the current historically low unemployment rate.  -->





<!-- Moreover, the government should be aware that relatively small unemployment rate may reflect the labour shortage, which is likely to cause problems like losses of employers and increasing inflation.  -->
