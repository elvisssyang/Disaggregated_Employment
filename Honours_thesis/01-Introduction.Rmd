# The Australian COVID-19 Pandemic Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive effect on economies around the world. Across different countries, millions of workers were furloughed or even lost their jobs as businesses struggled to survive [@ny2020]. The same situation happened in Australia, due to more restrictions, many businesses closed their doors, while employees were working with less hours or being dismissed by companies. As a result of the continuous "lockdown" periods in 2020, estimates made by the Australian Bureau of Statistics [@ABS2021] concluded that 72% of businesses generated less revenue and the underemployment rate hit a historical high of 13.8% by the end of April, 2020, only one month after the COVID-19 outbreak.

Our research is motivated by the lack of quantitative research on the employment of two-digit disaggregated industry sectors in Australia, while many studies have focused on the aggregated employment rate. A general problem of aggregated research is the loss of hierarchical information, which may result in a biased conclusion or "an illusion of employment prosperity". Thus, a quantitative analysis of the sectoral employment will ameliorate this problem, giving us a better scope to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 in Australia.





## Research Aim and questions 

This research will extend @anderson2020 by using data on 87 two-digit industry sectors instead of 19 sectors that they used. I will develop a model for the two-digit sectors to evaluate the long run effect and the COVID-19 post-impacts. I will also provide a counterfactual analysis based on an optimistic assumption of no pandemic or major events happened. The two-digit sectoral data will provide us more information, which will assist in getting a better understanding of employment dynamics in Australia on a more disaggregated level.

The overall research aim is to provide estimates of two-digit sectoral employment based on historical data. Specifically, my goals are: 

1. To construct a time series model of employment in 87 two-digit sectors of the Australian economy.

1. To use this model to conduct a counterfactual analysis. 

3. To use this model to determine which two-digit sectors have the highest impact (or positive spillover) on employment growth in the long run.



## Thesis Structure 


This thesis focuses on analysing Australian Employment at a disaggregated level, then estimate the long run effects of the COVID-19 to sectoral employment rate in Australia. The remainder of the thesis is structured as follows. First, in chapter 2, I review the existing literature in the relevant fields. Second, in chapter 3, I will provide exploratory data analysis and data resources. Then, I will propose our selected model in chapter 4. After we selected our model, I will conduct counterfactual analysis to evaluate the damages of COVID-19 and provide useful insights on key beneficial industries after COVID-19 in chapter 5. Eventually, I will provide a brief conclusion and discuss the limitations of our works and possible future extensions in chapter 6.
