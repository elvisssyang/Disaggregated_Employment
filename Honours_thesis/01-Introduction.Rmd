# The Australian COVID-19 Pandemic Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive effect on economies around the world. Across different countries, millions of workers were furloughed or even lost their jobs as businesses struggled to survive [@ny2020]. The same situation happened in Australia, due to more restrictions, many businesses closed their doors, while employees were working with less hours or being dismissed by companies. As a result of the continuous "lockdown" periods in 2020, estimates made by the Australian Bureau of Statistics [@ABS2021] concluded that 72% of businesses generated less revenue and the underemployment rate hit a historical high of 13.8% by the end of April, 2020, only one month after the COVID-19 outbreak.

Our research is motivated by the lack of quantitative research on the employment of two-digit disaggregated industry sectors in Australia, as many studies have focused on the aggregated employment rate. A general problem of aggregated research is the loss of hierarchical information, which may result in a biased conclusion or "an illusion of employment prosperity". Thus, a quantitative analysis of the sectoral employment will ameliorate this problem, giving us a better scope to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 in Australia.





## Research Aim and questions 

This research will extend @anderson2020 by using data on 87 two-digit industry sectors instead of 19 sectors that they used. I will develop a model for the two-digit sectors to evaluate the long run effect and the COVID-19 post-impacts. I will also provide a counterfactual analysis based on the assumption "if there is no pandemic". The two-digit sectoral data will provide us with more information, which will assist in getting a better understanding of employment dynamics in Australia.

The overall research aim is to provide estimates of two-digit sectoral employment based on historical data. Specifically, my goals are: 

1. To construct a time series model of employment in 87 two-digit sectors of the Australian economy.

1. To use this model to conduct a counterfactual analysis. 

3. To use this model to determine which two-digit sectors have the highest impact (or positive spillover) on employment growth in the long run.



## Thesis Structure 


This thesis focuses on analyzing Australian Employment at a disaggregated level, then estimate the long run effects of the COVID-19 to sectoral employment rate in Australia. The remainder of the thesis is structured as follows. In chapter 2, we review the existing literature in the relevant fields. In chapter 3, we will provide exploratory data analysis and data resources.
