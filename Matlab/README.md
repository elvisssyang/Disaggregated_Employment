# Matlab 

This is the proposed forecast experiment algorithm for selecting the optimal lambda then return the optimal phi for the estimated one lag Bayesian VARX model. 

- The _funcs folder contains all the packages used in this algorithm 

- The min_RMSFE.m is the main file of the algorithm 

- The phi_lambda_min.csv is the estimated coefficient for the BVARX model. 

- Both ABSemp.xlsx and ABSemp.csv are the employment by two-digit subsectors in Australia
